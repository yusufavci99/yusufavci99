# Hi there

I'm Yusuf, a backend developer.  

I've been working professionally since 2021. My professional work lives in private Bitbucket repositories under NDA, so this GitHub is not a showcase of my production code.
Instead, what you'll find here are mostly older student projects, experiments, and hobby ideas — the things I’ve used to explore, learn, and have fun with programming.

Outside of work, I've been keeping my personal website on Github pages.

Thanks for stopping by.
